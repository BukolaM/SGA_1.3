But since that doesn't give him any serious engagements he doesn't continue and soon returns to Obi. He's a manipulator. If all Obidients will heed the advice to stop commenting, in no time he'll fizzle out. Control yourself, ignore his tweets.\n",
      "1603845932927385600 2022-12-16 21:14:03 +0100 <elnyason> All well meaning Obidients must encourage others to resist the temptation to engage his tweets in any way. That is the only way to silence him. Obidients are just the ones giving him relevance at the moment. His other tweets get almost zero engagements so he's depressed.\n",
      "1603845929592823809 2022-12-16 21:14:02 +0100 <elnyason> Reno Omokri virtually tweets for Obidients to give him engagements. So he thinks of d most annoying things to say about Obi to trigger Obidients. Unfortunately some naive Obidients keep falling for it. They must know they're paying our enemy for attacking us &amp; so encouraging him.\n",
